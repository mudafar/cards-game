<!--- Before filling this out, please follow commit guidelines: -->
<!--- https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/ -->
<!--- In short: first line ~50 chars, then blank line, then bullets or paragraph summarizing. -->

<!--- Please explain the choices and tradeoffs you made, libraries, what could be done better with more time, etc. -->
### Please note that this is my first time using both Typescript and Tailwind.
   
* Choices:
  * By component folder structure.
  * Some FP paradigm.
  * Accessibility for screen reader.
  * Error boundary.
  
* Tradeoffs:
  * Testing coverage.
  * Responsive for smaller mobile devices.  
 
* Libraries:
  * Redux.
  * react-error-boundary
  * react-confetti
  * @react-hook/window-size

* Could have done better:
  * More testing, specifically abstract the random selection and make it easier for testing.
  * Documentation.
  * Log errors.
  * SEO, SSR and rehydrate.
     

* Estimated time taken to do this exercise: ~ 2.5 days <!--- (please separate for frontend/backend if doing both) -->
